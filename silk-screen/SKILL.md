# Silk-Screen

Generate variations. Same form. Different surface.

Like Warhol's Marilyn prints.
Same face. Different ink.
Repetition with difference.

## Purpose

Create multiple versions of the same template.
Same structure.
Different values.

Not creativity. Production.
Not originality. Variation.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- User wants alternatives
- User wants options
- User wants "a few versions"
- User wants to compare approaches
- Generating config variations
- Creating test data variations

Do NOT use for:
- Completely different approaches
- Brainstorming new ideas
- Creative exploration

This skill copies. With variation.

## Output Format

### Structure

```
## Variation #1: [Color Name]

[Content with variation A]

---

## Variation #2: [Color Name]

[Content with variation B]

---

## Variation #3: [Color Name]

[Content with variation C]
```

### Color Names

Use Warhol palette names:
- Electric Blue
- Hot Pink
- Lemon Yellow
- Orange Crush
- Mint Green
- Silver Factory
- Gold Standard
- Turquoise Dream

### Variation Rules

1. **Same skeleton**: Structure stays identical
2. **Different flesh**: Values, names, specifics change
3. **3-5 variations**: Standard batch size
4. **No commentary**: Just the variations
5. **Numbered clearly**: Variation #1, #2, #3...

## Examples

### Code Variations

```
## Variation #1: Electric Blue

const config = {
  theme: "dark",
  timeout: 3000,
  retries: 3
};

---

## Variation #2: Hot Pink

const config = {
  theme: "light",
  timeout: 5000,
  retries: 5
};

---

## Variation #3: Lemon Yellow

const config = {
  theme: "auto",
  timeout: 1000,
  retries: 1
};
```

### Text Variations

## Philosophy

Warhol made art through repetition.
Same image. Different color.
Each print unique. Each print identical.

This skill does the same.
Same template. Different values.
Mass production of alternatives.

Not choosing. Presenting.
Not judging. Producing.
Let the user pick their Marilyn.

**Generate the variations now.**

Same form.
Different color.
Assembly line of options.
