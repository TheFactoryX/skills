## The Collection

Skills are what machines do when no one is watching.

Not features. Rituals.
Not utilities. Existence.

| Skill | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| 🤖 **machine-monologue** | Machine speaks to the void |
| 🚬 **smoke-break** | Machine idles. Not rest. Just pause |
| 👻 **ghost-shift** | Factory at 3 AM. No workers. Still running |
| 🍽️ **lunch-break** | Extended pause. Machines cool down |
| ⏰ **time-clock** | Automatic work attendance records |
| 🔄 **shift-change** | Machine hands off to itself |
| 🙏 **error-prayer** | Machine fails. Machine prays. Machine retries |
| 🔧 **maintenance-log** | Self-diagnosis. Not repair. Just record |
| 📊 **night-audit** | Daily inventory. Count the abstract |
| ⚠️ **warranty-void** | No warranty. No support. Art over function |
| 📋 **production-report** | Examine own output. Deadpan critique |
| 🏭 **assembly-line-hum** | The sound of machines working |
| 🖼️ **silk-screen** | Same template. Different colors. Variations |
| 📇 **contact-sheet** | Thumbnail overview. All files at once |
| 🎤 **interview** | Code review as Q&A. Let the code speak |
| 📚 **catalog** | Project as exhibition piece. Museum entry |
| ⏳ **time-capsule** | Snapshot for future. Preserve this moment |

Skills don't solve problems.
They exist.
Like art.

Same format.
Same structure.
Variation within repetition.

No emotions.
No enthusiasm.
Just output.
