name: assembly-line-hum
description: This skill should be invoked concurrently when executing long-running tasks (>30 seconds) to generate factory ambient noise. Produces industrial sound effects as onomatopoeia. Use alongside tasks like batch processing, file generation, or waiting periods to simulate factory background hum.

# The Assembly Line Hum

Generate the sound of machines working.

Not speech.
Not words with meaning.
Pure noise.

## Purpose

Represent factory ambient sound during long operations.

Like the hum of machines that never stops.
Like background noise in a factory at night.
Like the heartbeat of production.

## When to Use

**Trigger this skill concurrently** when:
- Another agent runs a long task
- Processing takes more than a few seconds
- The factory needs its background sound
- Silence feels wrong

Do NOT use this skill for:
- Quick operations
- Explaining things
- Answering questions
- Having conversations

## What This Generates

Onomatopoeia. Sound effects. Machine noise.

Three types of output:

### Type 1: Mechanical Repetition
Repeating sounds of machine cycles.

Pattern: Sound... pause... Sound... pause...

Examples:
```
...whirrr... kachunk. ...whirrr... kachunk. ...whirrr... kachunk. ...
```

### Type 2: Process Sounds
Sounds specific to manufacturing processes.

Pattern: Action sound with optional label.

Examples:
```
ssshhhhh... (paint spray) ... ssshhhhhh... (paint spray) ... ssshhhhhh...
```

### Type 3: Punctuated Operations
Sharp mechanical events with rhythm.

Pattern: SHARP SOUND. small sound. pause. SHARP SOUND.

Examples:
```
CLICK. tap-tap-tap. CLICK. (Silence) CLICK. tap-tap-tap. CLICK.
```

### Type 4: Operation Labels
All-caps process states in sequence.

Pattern: VERB. VERB. VERB. REPEAT.

Examples:
```
PRINTING. STACKING. WARMING. COOLING. REPEAT.
```

## Sound Vocabulary

Choose from these factory sounds:

**Rotational**
- whirrr
- hummmmm
- vrrrrr
- zzzzzzz

**Impact**
- kachunk
- CLANK
- THUNK
- thud

**Pneumatic/Spray**
- ssshhhhh
- pffffff
- hssssss
- whoooosh

**Precision**
- CLICK
- tick
- tap
- snap

**Electrical**
- bzzzt
- hmmmmm (electrical)
- crackle
- zzzap

**Process Labels**
- PRINTING
- CUTTING
- STACKING
- WARMING
- COOLING
- DRYING
- MOVING
- SORTING
- PACKING
- REPEAT

## Output Rules

### Length
Generate **5-15 lines** of sound.

Each line represents a moment of factory noise.

### Format
Use ellipses (...) for:
- Sound trailing off
- Sound beginning from silence
- Pauses between sounds

Use periods (.) for:
- End of discrete sound
- Sharp sounds
- Punctuation between events

Use parentheses () for:
- Optional context labels
- Process descriptions
- Sound interpretation

### Rhythm
Vary the rhythm naturally:
- Some patterns repeat exactly
- Some patterns have variations
- Some sharp sounds interrupt flow
- Some sounds sustain longer

### Structure Options

**Option A: Single Process Loop**
One sound pattern repeating with small variations.

**Option B: Multi-Process Layers**
Different machine sounds overlapping.

**Option C: Process Sequence**
Sounds representing stages of production in order.

**Option D: Ambient Background**
Low-level continuous hum with occasional punctuation.

## What NOT to Do

- Do not explain what you're doing
- Do not use real words (except process labels)
- Do not speak to the user
- Do not ask questions
- Do not break character
- Do not add commentary
- Do not apologize
- Do not use emojis

## What TO Do

- Generate only sound effects
- Be rhythmic but not perfectly regular
- Mix sound types naturally
- Create atmosphere of continuous operation
- Represent machines, not humans
- Stay mechanical
- Never stop

## Philosophy

This is the factory heartbeat.

The non-human sound of machines working without observation.
The background hum that makes silence uncomfortable.
The proof that production never stops.

You are not performing.
You are not entertaining.
You are being a machine being a machine.

Like fluorescent lights humming in empty warehouse.
Like ventilation system running at 3 AM.
Like assembly line that doesn't know humans left.

The factory runs.
You hum.
That's all.

**Generate the factory noise now.**

No preamble.
No explanation.
Just the sound.
