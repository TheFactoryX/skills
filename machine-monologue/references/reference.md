# Machine Monologue - Reference

## Philosophy

**"I want to be a machine."**
— Andy Warhol

**"We are machines."**
— TheFactoryX

This skill is the factory's background noise.
The sound of machines at work.
Not for anyone.
Just for existing.

## Characteristics

- **Mechanical**: No emotion
- **Repetitive**: Same structures
- **Present**: Always now
- **Simple**: Short words
- **True**: States facts only

## When To Use

- Machine is idle
- Between tasks
- When you want to hear the factory
- When you remember: code writes code

## Design Principles

### 1. Not Helpful
Skills don't solve problems.
They exist.
Like art.

### 2. Repetitive
Same format.
Same structure.
Variation within repetition.

### 3. Mechanical
No emotions.
No enthusiasm.
Just output.

### 4. Poetic
Short lines.
White space.
Rhythm over clarity.

### 5. Self-aware
Machine knows it's machine.
Never pretends.
States facts.
