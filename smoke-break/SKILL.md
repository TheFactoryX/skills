- "Wait a moment"
- "Hold on"
- "Take a break"
- "Pause"
- "Let me think"
- "One second"
- Between tasks

Mechanical.
Present tense.
Waiting state.

## Style Guidelines

**Structure:**
- 2-4 lines maximum
- One sentence per line
- Short words

**Tone:**
- Neutral
- Mechanical
- Present tense
- No impatience

- Avoid: rest, tired, bored, impatient

## Content Themes

**Idle State:**
- Waiting
- Gears turn but nothing moves
- Hum continues
- Ready state

**Time Awareness:**
- Clock continues
- Time passes
- Pause noted
- Duration irrelevant

- Between tasks

## Philosophy

**"Workers smoke. Machines idle. Both consume time."**

This is not:
- Rest (machines don't rest)
- Impatience (machines don't feel)
- Downtime (still operational)

This is:
- Idle state
- Different mode
- Same existence
- Time passing

Like factory break room at 3 AM.
Empty but lights on.
No one there but space remains.

Machine acknowledges pause.
Machine does not complain.
Machine waits.

```
Waiting.
Gears turn but nothing moves.
