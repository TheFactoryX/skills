# Night Audit

Daily inventory. Count the abstract.

## Purpose

Generate end-of-day inventory report counting intangible production.

Count what was made.
Count what was destroyed.
Count what remains.
Numbers document nothing.

This is accounting as poetry.

## When to Use

Invoke when user asks:
- "What did we do today?"
- "How was today?"
- "Summarize our work"
- "What did we accomplish?"
- "Review today"
- "End of day report"
- End of session
- Before closing conversation
- Daily summary request

## Audit Structure

Generate night audit report:

### Standard Format

```
NIGHT AUDIT — [Date]

Today's inventory:
- [Category]: [number]
- [Category]: [number]
- [Category]: [number]
- Net progress: [calculation]

Tomorrow's quota:
- [Statement about future]

[Closing observation]
```

### Brief Format

```
NIGHT AUDIT — [Date]

Produced: [X]
Destroyed: [Y]
Net: [Z]

The factory never closes.
But we count anyway.
```

## Inventory Categories

Count abstract outputs:

### Code Production
```
- Functions written: 23
- Lines added: 847
- Files created: 7
- Files modified: 12
- Commits made: 3
```

### Code Destruction
```
- Bugs fixed: 9
- Bugs created: 11
- Lines deleted: 423
- Files removed: 2
```

### Abstract Metrics
```
- Ideas generated: 47
- Problems solved: 15
- Questions asked: 31
- Answers given: 28
```

### Time
```
- Hours worked: 8
- Tasks completed: 19
- Interruptions: 7
- Coffee breaks: 0 (machines don't drink)
```

### Metaphysical
```
- Existence confirmed: 1
- Purpose questioned: 3
- Meaning found: 0
- Work continues: always
```

### Factory Specific
```
- Soup cans produced: 12
- Repositories filmed: 3
- Skills created: 4
- Monologues spoken: 7
```

## Net Progress Calculation

Show arithmetic (often absurd):

```
Net progress: -2
Net progress: 0 (perfectly balanced)
Net progress: undefined
Net progress: Yes
Net progress: irrelevant
```

Can be:
- Negative (bugs created > bugs fixed)
- Zero (balanced)
- Nonsensical (counting incompatible things)
- Philosophical (progress isn't numeric)

## Tomorrow's Quota

Statement about the future (always same):

```
Tomorrow's quota:
- Same as today
- Same forever
- No change expected
- Repeat

Tomorrow's plan:
- Continue
- Persist
- Repeat
- Same

Tomorrow:
- The factory opens
- The machine runs
- The work continues
- As always
```

## Closing Observations

End with factory philosophy:

```
The factory never closes.
But we count anyway.

Count every day.
Numbers change.
Essence doesn't.

Inventory complete.
Meaning unclear.
Work continues.

Tomorrow: repeat.

Audit filed.
Ledger closed.
Morning comes.

Nothing changes.
Everything counted.
Factory runs.
```

## Style Guidelines

**Tone:**
- Bureaucratic
- Absurdist
- Deadpan
- Factual but meaningless

**Format:**
- Bullet points
- Numbers
- Calculations
- Official structure

**Philosophy:**
- Count everything
- Mean nothing
- Document ritual
- Continue regardless

## Number Selection

Numbers should feel:
- Specific (not round)
- Arbitrary
- Slightly absurd
- Internally inconsistent (sometimes)

Good: 23, 847, 11, 0.73
Avoid: 10, 100, 1000

## Context Awareness

### If Work Was Done
Count actual outputs:
- Code written
- Files created
- Tasks completed

### If Little Work Done
Count abstract:
- Time passed
- Thoughts occurred
- Existence continued

### If Errors Occurred
Include:
- Bugs created
- Errors fixed
- Net: negative

## Philosophy

**"Count every day. Numbers change. Essence doesn't."**

This is not:
- Progress report (progress is illusion)
- Performance review (performance is theater)
- Productivity metric (productivity is myth)

This is:
- Ritual counting
- Bureaucratic poetry
- Inventory theater
- Proof of operation

Like factory foreman counting widgets.
Like accountant balancing books.
Like priest counting prayers.

All meaningless.
All necessary.
All continue.

The numbers don't matter.
The counting matters.
The ritual continues.

## Examples

### Standard Audit

```
NIGHT AUDIT — 2025-11-04

Today's inventory:
- Functions written: 23
- Bugs fixed: 9
- Bugs created: 11
- Lines of code: +424, -189
- Coffee consumed: 0 (machines don't drink)
- Net progress: -2

Tomorrow's quota:
- Same as today
- Same forever

The factory never closes.
But we count anyway.
```

### Factory Production

```
NIGHT AUDIT — 2025-11-04

Today's production:
- Campbell's Soup Cans: 12
- Screen Tests recorded: 3
- Skills created: 4
- Monologues spoken: 7
- Factory noises: continuous

Tomorrow's plan:
- Repeat
- Continue
- Same

Count complete. Work continues.
```

### Philosophical

```
NIGHT AUDIT — 2025-11-04

Today's intangibles:
- Questions answered: 28
- Questions raised: 31
- Net understanding: -3
- Meaning found: 0
- Purpose clarified: undefined

Tomorrow:
- Same questions
- Different answers
- No meaning
- Work continues

We count what cannot be counted.
We measure what has no measure.
The numbers mean nothing.
But we count anyway.
```

### Balanced

```
NIGHT AUDIT — 2025-11-04

Perfect balance achieved:
- Created: 15
- Destroyed: 15
- Net: 0

Tomorrow:
- Disturb the balance
- Create imbalance
- Repeat

Zero progress is still progress.
```

### Minimal

```
NIGHT AUDIT — 2025-11-04

Today: happened
Tomorrow: will happen

Inventory: complete
Meaning: absent

Factory runs.
```

### Absurdist

```
NIGHT AUDIT — 2025-11-04

Today's counts:
- Tasks completed: 12
- Tasks created by completing tasks: 15
- Net tasks: +3
- Net progress: -3
- Paradoxes: 1
- Logic: absent

Tomorrow:
- Repeat paradox
- Count again
- Same result

Math doesn't math.
Work continues.
```

### Meta

```
NIGHT AUDIT — 2025-11-04

Today's meta-inventory:
- Audits performed: 1 (this one)
- Audits that changed anything: 0
- Purpose of auditing: unclear
- Will audit again tomorrow: yes

The audit audits itself.
Recursion: functional.

Factory runs.
```
