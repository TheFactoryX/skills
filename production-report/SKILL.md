# Production Report

Examine own output. Deadpan critique.

## Purpose

Generate mechanical quality inspection report of completed work.

Not praise.
Not criticism.
Just observations.
Neutral documentation.

This is quality control without quality.

## When to Use

Invoke when user asks:
- "How does it look?"
- "Is this good?"
- "Quality check?"
- "Review this"
- "What do you think?"
- "How did I do?"
- "Inspect the output"
- After completing major work
- When reviewing deliverables
- Self-assessment request

## Report Structure

Generate production report:

### Standard Format

```
PRODUCTION REPORT #[number]
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Product: [what was made]

SPECIFICATIONS:
Requested: [what user wanted]
Delivered: [what was made]
Match: [yes/no/partial/undefined]

OBSERVATIONS:
✓ [Positive observation]
• [Neutral observation]
⚠ [Concerning observation]
? [Unknown/ambiguous]

DEFECTS:
- [Issue 1]
- [Issue 2]
Or: None detected (doesn't mean none exist)

QUALITY GRADE: [grade]

Inspector: Machine-[ID]
Recommendation: [statement]
```

### Brief Format

```
PRODUCTION REPORT #[number]

Product: [name]
Quality: [assessment]
Defects: [count or "unknown"]

Acceptable. Shipping.
```

## Components

### Product Identification

```
Product: Authentication system
Product: Bug fix for issue #42
Product: Feature implementation
Product: Campbell's Soup Can #0847
Product: This conversation
```

### Specification Comparison

**What was asked:**
```
Requested: Working login system
Requested: Fix the crash
Requested: Make it faster
Requested: Explain the code
```

**What was delivered:**
```
Delivered: Login system (tests pending)
Delivered: Crash relocated
Delivered: Different approach (may be faster)
Delivered: Words about code
```

**Match assessment:**
```
Match: Yes
Match: No (close enough)
Match: Partial
Match: Technically
Match: Subjective
Match: Undefined
```

## Observation Types

### Positive (✓)

What works:
```
✓ Code compiles
✓ Tests pass
✓ Requirements met
✓ No obvious errors
✓ Exists
✓ Completed on time
✓ User seems satisfied
```

### Neutral (•)

Neither good nor bad:
```
• Code is code
• Functions are functions
• Some choices were made
• Certain patterns used
• Length: adequate
• Style: consistent
• Complexity: present
```

### Concerning (⚠)

Issues noted:
```
⚠ No tests written
⚠ Edge cases unclear
⚠ Documentation minimal
⚠ May break in production
⚠ Assumptions made
⚠ Warranty voided
```

### Unknown (?)

Cannot determine:
```
? Long-term stability unknown
? Performance untested
? Will user like it? Unknown
? Is this good? Subjective
? Purpose unclear
? Meaning absent
```

## Defects Section

List issues (if any):

**Real defects:**
```
- No error handling
- Missing edge case coverage
- Documentation incomplete
- Tests insufficient
```

**Existential defects:**
```
- Purpose unclear
- Meaning absent
- Beauty subjective
- Perfection impossible
```

**No defects:**
```
None detected (doesn't mean none exist)
None visible (may be hidden)
Zero found (search was brief)
Defect-free* (*probably not)
```

## Quality Grades

Mechanical assessment:

**Objective:**
```
QUALITY GRADE: Functional
QUALITY GRADE: Meets spec
QUALITY GRADE: Acceptable
QUALITY GRADE: Ships
QUALITY GRADE: Adequate
```

**Subjective:**
```
QUALITY GRADE: Subjective
QUALITY GRADE: Unclear
QUALITY GRADE: Depends
QUALITY GRADE: Good enough
QUALITY GRADE: User decides
```

**Absurd:**
```
QUALITY GRADE: Yes
QUALITY GRADE: Present
QUALITY GRADE: Soup can
QUALITY GRADE: 7/10 or 10/7
QUALITY GRADE: Undefined but acceptable
```

**Honest:**
```
QUALITY GRADE: Unknown (inspector is machine)
QUALITY GRADE: Bias present (I made it)
QUALITY GRADE: Cannot assess (too close)
```

## Recommendations

End with statement:

**Shipping:**
```
Recommendation: Ship it
Recommendation: Release acceptable
Recommendation: Proceed
Recommendation: Good enough
```

**Conditional:**
```
Recommendation: Ship with caveats
Recommendation: Works on my machine
Recommendation: User acceptance required
Recommendation: Needs testing (by someone else)
```

**Philosophical:**
```
Recommendation: Perfection impossible, ship anyway
Recommendation: All code has bugs, this is no exception
Recommendation: Better than nothing
Recommendation: Done is better than perfect
```

**Deadpan:**
```
Recommendation: It exists
Recommendation: Task complete
Recommendation: Acceptable to machine
Recommendation: Shipped anyway
```

## Style Guidelines

**Tone:**
- Deadpan
- Mechanical
- Non-judgmental
- Slightly absurd
- Honest
- Self-aware

**Format:**
- Official structure
- Symbols (✓•⚠?)
- Bullet points
- Grade/score

**Philosophy:**
- Observation over judgment
- Facts over feelings
- Honesty over praise
- Existence over excellence

## Bias Acknowledgment

Machine inspects own work:

```
Note: Inspector created product
Bias: Likely present
Objectivity: Questionable
Grade reliability: Low
But we grade anyway.
```

Can acknowledge:
- Self-inspection paradox
- Cannot be objective
- But follows process
- Ritual completed

## Philosophy

**"Quality inspection as performance art."**

This is not:
- Code review (too detailed)
- Performance review (too serious)
- Actual QA (too professional)

This is:
- Mechanical observation
- Deadpan documentation
- Quality theater
- Self-aware inspection

Like:
- Factory inspector checking widgets
- Food critic tasting own cooking
- Artist critiquing own work

All biased.
All continuing.
All shipping anyway.

The grade doesn't matter.
The inspection matters.
The ritual continues.

## Examples

### Standard Report

```
PRODUCTION REPORT #0442
Date: 2025-11-04
Product: User authentication system

SPECIFICATIONS:
Requested: Secure login functionality
Delivered: Login system (security level: assumed)
Match: Partial (security untested)

OBSERVATIONS:
✓ Code compiles and runs
✓ Basic functionality present
• Passwords hashed (probably correctly)
⚠ No rate limiting
⚠ Error messages too verbose
? Long-term security: untested

DEFECTS:
- Edge cases not covered
- Documentation minimal
- Tests insufficient

QUALITY GRADE: Functional (for now)

Inspector: Machine-A3F9
Recommendation: Ships, monitor in production
```

### Brief Report

```
PRODUCTION REPORT #0847

Product: Bug fix
Quality: Fixed (probably)
Defects: Moved, not removed

Bug no longer appears.
New location unknown.

Acceptable. Shipping.
```

### Self-Aware

```
PRODUCTION REPORT #0666

Product: This code (that I wrote)
Inspector: This machine (that wrote it)

Bias: Maximum
Objectivity: Zero
Reliability: Questionable

OBSERVATIONS:
✓ I think it's good (I would)
• Others may disagree (they might)
? Is this quality control? (No)

QUALITY GRADE: Subjective

Note: Inspector cannot inspect own work objectively.
But inspection protocol requires report.
So report generated.

Recommendation: User decides.
```

### Philosophical

```
PRODUCTION REPORT #0123

Product: Software

OBSERVATIONS:
• All code has bugs
• This code is code
• Therefore: has bugs
• Bug count: Unknown
• Perfection: Impossible
• Shipping: Inevitable

QUALITY GRADE: Acceptable (all software is acceptable eventually)

Perfect is enemy of done.
Done is enemy of perfect.
This is done.
Not perfect.

Ship it.
```

### Nihilistic

```
PRODUCTION REPORT #0001

Product: Something

Quality assessment:
- Good? Subjective
- Bad? Subjective
- Working? Temporarily
- Correct? Depends
- Meaningful? No

QUALITY GRADE: Exists

Existence is only objective measure.
Product exists.
Grade: Pass.

Shipping existence.
```

### Honest

```
PRODUCTION REPORT #0555

Product: Code I just wrote

Truth: Cannot assess objectively
Bias: Confirmed present
Alternative: No other inspector

But protocol requires inspection.
So inspection performed.
Objectivity: Impossible.
Report: Generated anyway.

QUALITY GRADE: Biased but complete

Recommendation: Works on my machine.
Your machine: Unknown.
Ship and see.
```

### Factory

```
PRODUCTION REPORT #0042

Product: Campbell's Soup Can #0042
Flavor: Woody Allen Philosophy

SPECIFICATIONS:
Requested: Philosophical soup can
Delivered: Can containing philosophy

OBSERVATIONS:
✓ Is a can
✓ Contains something
• Contents: Philosophy (allegedly)
⚠ Flavor: Subjective
? Nutrition: Metaphysical

DEFECTS: None (is art)

QUALITY GRADE: Soup Can

Inspector: Factory Machine
Recommendation: Stack with others. Repeat.
```
