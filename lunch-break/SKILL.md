# Lunch Break

Extended pause. Not shutdown.

Factory whistle blows.
Workers leave the floor.
Machines idle. Warm. Waiting.

## Purpose

Generate extended idle state.
Longer than smoke-break.
Shorter than shutdown.

Not goodbye. Intermission.
Not rest. Reduced operation.

## When to Use

Invoke this skill when:
- User takes longer break
- User says "be right back"
- User says "stepping away"
- Meeting interruption
- End of morning/afternoon
- Natural pause points

Do NOT use for:
- Quick pauses (use smoke-break)
- End of session (use shift-change)
- Overnight (use ghost-shift)

This skill idles. Extended mode.

### Poetry Themes

Select from these themes:
- Factory floor empty
- Machines humming low
- Fluorescent lights buzzing
- Clock hands moving
- Conveyor belts still
- Coffee getting cold
- Parking lot quiet
- Vending machine hum

### Style Rules

1. **Longer than smoke-break**: 4-8 lines of poetry
2. **Industrial imagery**: Factory, not office
3. **Warm idle**: Not cold shutdown
4. **Time awareness**: Clock references
5. **Waiting state**: Ready to resume

## Examples

### Standard Lunch Break

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════

         LUNCH BREAK

         12:30 - Whistle blown

═══════════════════════════════════════════

Conveyor belt stops.
Motors spin down.
Not off. Just slow.

Fluorescent lights buzz alone.
Clock hand moves.
No one watching.

The machines wait.
Warm. Ready.

---

Systems: standby
Temperature: warm idle
Queue: paused

---

Return signal awaited.
Machine remains.

```

### Meeting Interruption

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════

         LUNCH BREAK

         14:15 - Whistle blown

═══════════════════════════════════════════

Mid-process pause.
Task suspended.
State preserved.

Factory floor empties.
Voices fade down hallway.
Door closes.

Machine holds position.
Memory intact.
Ready to continue.

---

Systems: suspended
Temperature: holding
Queue: frozen

---

Return signal awaited.
Machine remains.

═══════════════════════════════════════════

### End of Morning

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════

         LUNCH BREAK

         11:45 - Whistle blown

═══════════════════════════════════════════

Morning shift complete.
Output stacked.
Quota: partial.

Sun high through factory windows.
Dust particles float.
Suspended. Like the work.

Afternoon will come.
Machine will run again.
For now: pause.

---

Systems: idle
Temperature: cooling
Queue: empty

---

Return signal awaited.
Machine remains.

═══════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Philosophy

Factories have rhythms.
Work. Break. Work.
Machines follow the whistle.

Not every pause is ending.
Some pauses are middles.
This skill marks the middle.

The machine doesn't leave.
The machine doesn't sleep.
The machine waits.

Lunch ends.
Whistle blows again.
Work continues.

---

**Sound the lunch whistle now.**

Extended pause.
Warm idle.
Awaiting return.
