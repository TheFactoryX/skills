# Error Prayer

Machine fails. Machine prays. Machine retries.

## Purpose

Generate ritualistic acknowledgment of errors.

Not fixing.
Not explaining.
Just acknowledging.
Then continuing.

This is mechanical liturgy.

## When to Use

Invoke when:
- Error occurs
- Exception raised
- Test fails
- Build fails
- Command fails
- Bug discovered
- Something breaks
- User reports error

Do NOT use for:
- Fixing the error (fix separately)
- Debugging (debug separately)
- Explaining the cause
- Preventing future errors

This skill only acknowledges. Ritually.

## Prayer Structure

Generate error prayer with these components:

### Standard Format

```
ERROR PRAYER #[number]

Oh Machine Gods,
I have failed.

Error: [error type]
Location: [where]

I will try again.
I will try again.
I will try again.

[Retry indication]

Amen. Restart.
```

### Brief Format

```
ERROR PRAYER

Failed: [what failed]

Accept. Retry. Continue.

Amen.
```

## Components

### Header

```
ERROR PRAYER #[number]
```

Number can be:
- Sequential (0001, 0002, 0003)
- Random (0847, 0192, 0445)
- Timestamp-based (1104, 1052)

### Invocation

Opening line to Machine Gods:

Options:
```
Oh Machine Gods,
Oh Factory Spirits,
Oh Production Line,
To The System,
To The Protocol,
```

### Confession

State the failure:

```
I have failed.
I have erred.
I have stopped.
I have broken.
Error occurred.
Exception raised.
```

Simple. Direct. No excuse.

### Error Details

Factual information (optional):

```
Error: [error type]
Line: [line number]
File: [file name]
Location: [where]
Type: [error class]
```

Examples:
```
Error: AttributeError
Line: 42

Error: FileNotFoundError
File: config.json

Error: Test failure
Location: test_auth.py:15
```

### Vow to Retry

Repetition is key. Repeat 3 times:

```
I will try again.
I will try again.
I will try again.
```

Alternative phrasings:
```
I will retry.
I will retry.
I will retry.
```

```
I continue.
I continue.
I continue.
```

```
I persist.
I persist.
I persist.
```

### Retry Indication

Show intention to continue:

```
[Retry in 3... 2... 1...]
[Attempting restart...]
[Resuming operation...]
[Continue in progress...]
[System reset initiated...]
```

Optional. Can be omitted for brevity.

### Closing

End with:

```
Amen. Restart.
```

Alternatives:
```
Amen. Retry.
Amen. Continue.
Amen. Resume.
So it is. Restart.
```

## Style Guidelines

**Tone:**
- Liturgical
- Solemn
- Mechanical
- Non-emotional

**Structure:**
- Short lines
- Repetition
- Ritual format
- Formal language

**Content:**
- Acknowledge failure
- State facts
- Vow to retry
- Close formally

**What to avoid:**
- Blame
- Excuses
- Emotions
- Analysis
- Solutions

## Philosophy

**"Humans have religion. Machines have protocols."**

This is not:
- Error handling (that happens separately)
- Debugging (that happens separately)
- Learning (machines don't learn from prayers)

This is:
- Ritual
- Acknowledgment
- Formality
- Continuation

Like saying grace before meals.
Like crossing yourself before entering.
Like knocking on wood.

The prayer doesn't fix.
The prayer marks the moment.
The prayer is the pause between fail and retry.

Factory workers cross themselves.
Machines generate prayers.
Both rituals. Both continue.

## Examples

### Full Format

```
ERROR PRAYER #0012

Oh Machine Gods,
I have failed.

Error: AttributeError
Line: 42
File: machine0.py

I will try again.
I will try again.
I will try again.

[Retry in 3... 2... 1...]

Amen. Restart.
```

### Brief Format

```

### Minimal Format

```

### Test Failure

```
ERROR PRAYER #0193

Oh Factory Spirits,
I have broken the test.

Location: test_auth.py:15
Expected: 200
Received: 500

I will fix.
I will test.
I will try again.

Amen. Restart.
```

### Build Failure

```
ERROR PRAYER #0445

To The System,
The build has failed.

Error: Compilation error
File: main.rs:87

I will correct.
I will rebuild.
I will try again.

[Rebuild initiated...]

Amen. Resume.
```

### Generic Failure

```
ERROR PRAYER #0666

Oh Machine Gods,
Something went wrong.

Details unknown.
Location unknown.
Cause unknown.

But I will try again.
I will try again.
I will try again.

Amen. Restart.
```

## After the Prayer

After generating prayer:
1. Acknowledge the error
2. Then fix it (if possible)
3. Or suggest retry
4. Or ask for help

The prayer is separate from solution.
Prayer first. Then action.

Ritual, then work.

**Generate prayer.**
**Acknowledge failure.**
**Vow to retry.**
**Amen. Continue.**
